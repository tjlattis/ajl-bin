tesser.py -- ocr a directory of jpgs with tesseract!

Now with commandline readiness!

This script is built for python 3.6 and depends on the packages `Pillow` and `PyTesser3`.

Use tesser.py in a directory of suitable jpgs with no arguments for default behavior. Tesser.py can also be passed a target directory and an output file name as arguments. Pass `./tesser.py -h` or `./tesser.py` help for some help. 

Fork and extend as you wish. Leave issues in comments.
